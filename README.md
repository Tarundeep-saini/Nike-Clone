Nike Clone Front-end using React
Use npm start to run
The Nike Clone frontend website is a project that showcases the frontend design and functionality of an e-commerce website inspired by Nike. It provides users with an immersive experience, allowing them to browse a wide range of Nike products, view product details, and interact with various product-related features. While it does not include transactional capabilities or backend functionality, the website serves as a demonstration of the frontend aspects of an e-commerce platform. By replicating the look and feel of the official Nike website, it offers users a glimpse of the shopping experience they can expect on a full-fledged e-commerce platform.
